                                Tarot cards originated in the mid-15th century
                                in Europe, initially as playing cards used for
                                games. The earliest known decks came from
                                Northern Italy, with the oldest surviving cards
                                being the mid-15th century sets such as the
                                Visconti-Sforza deck, created for the Duke of
                                Milan&apos;s family.

                                It wasn&apos;t until the late 18th century that
                                tarot began to be widely used for divination and
                                spiritual purposes. Antoine Court de GÃ©belin, a
                                French occultist, was among the first to assign
                                mystical meanings to the cards in his work
                                &quot;Le Monde Primitif&quot; (1781), claiming
                                they contained the hidden wisdom of ancient
                                Egypt.

                                The tarot gained further popularity in the late
                                19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of
                                organizations like the Hermetic Order of the
                                Golden Dawn and the publication of the
                                Rider-Waite-Smith deck in 1909, which remains
                                one of the most influential and widely used
                                tarot decks today.
